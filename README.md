Neovim config entirely in [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org).

Fennel works in neovim 0.4 but I am also trying nvim-treesitter which needs the unreleased neovim 0.5.

Also trying out packages (`:help packages`) to avoid using any package manager. See the [init file](fnl/init.fnl) for which packages to download manually. Will eventually use git submodules or git subtree.
